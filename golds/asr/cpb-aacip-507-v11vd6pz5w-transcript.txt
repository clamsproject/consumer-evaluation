JIM LEHRER: Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight: Our summary of the news; then, a three-part look at the escalating violence in Iraq-- a report from Iraq by Jeffrey Gettleman of the "New York Times," analysis of the Shiite group and its leader that triggered some of the weekend attacks, and reaction from Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders, Senators Lugar and Biden. We close with some thoughts about how the steroids scandal is touching the new Major League Baseball season. 

NEWS SUMMARY

JIM LEHRER: U.S.-Led forces struck back on several fronts against the armed resistance in Iraq today. In Baghdad, U.S. Apache helicopters fired into a Shiite Muslim neighborhood after receiving small-arms fire. Troops stepped up patrols there and in another Shiite area, where fierce fighting killed eight U.S. troops and at least 52 Iraqis this weekend. In all, 12 American troops were killed in the last 24 hours. Also in Baghdad, U.S. officials branded a radical Shiite cleric an "outlaw," and announced a warrant for his arrest for the murder of a rival cleric last year. Moqtada Sadr implored his followers to stage the recent Shiite protests against the U.S. occupation. A U.S. Military spokesman said al-Sadr's militia threatens the country's stability.

BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT: We will take action, as and when necessary, to maintain a safe and secure environment in Iraq. Individuals who create violence, who incite violence, who execute violence against persons inside of Iraq will be hunted down and captured or killed. It is that simple. 

JIM LEHRER: In southern Iraq, Shiite protestors demanded the release of al-Sadr's imprisoned supporters. British troops exchanged gunfire with militiamen who seized the governor's office. And northwest of Baghdad, hundreds of U.S. Marines and Iraqi troops launched operation vigilant resolve in the city of Fallujah. They closed roads and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. U.S. commanders vowed to subdue the city after insurgents and rioters killed and then mutilated four American contractors there last week. President Bush said today the United States would stick to a June 30 power transfer in Iraq, despite the new violence. He told reporters in North Carolina the U.S. had an obligation to do so. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: The message to the Iraqi citizens is they don't have to fear that America will turn and run. That's an important message for them to hear. They think that we're not sincere about staying the course. Many people will not continue to take a risk toward, take the risk toward freedom and democracy. 

JIM LEHRER: The president said the U.S. would maintain a very strong military presence in Iraq after the hand-over. We'll have more on the Iraq violence story right after this News Summary. Spanish authorities today announced two more arrests in the Madrid train bombings. They were made Saturday, the same day at least four other suspects blew themselves up rather than surrender to police in Madrid. Three of those killed have been linked to the bombings. The alleged mastermind was among them. At least 16 people are being held in the March 11 bombing that killed 191 and injured some 1,800. Secretary of State Powell was in Haiti today. It was his first visit since former President Aristide went into exile. Powell urged the country's new prime minister to deny government posts to leaders of the rebellion that put him in power, especially those with criminal records. Gerard Latortue was appointed head of state after a week's-long popular insurrection. He later hailed some rebel leaders as freedom fighters. The sweeping power failure in eight states and Canada last summer could happen again. That was the conclusion of a final report issued today by a joint Canadian-American taskforce. It blamed the power industry for failing to follow its voluntary rules to ensure the reliable flow of electricity. And it said power companies needed to have mandatory standards, and strong enforcement of them. A flash flood killed at least 25 people in northern Mexico today. Rescue helicopters searched for 60 more missing residents in the border town of Piedras Negras, 150 miles southwest of San Antonio, Texas. Flooding in the region began yesterday, when thunderstorms dumped up to two feet of rain in parts of Mexico, Texas and New Mexico. The Pulitzer Prizes for 2004 were announced today. In journalism, the "Los Angeles Times" won in five categories, including for its coverage of Southern California's wildfires last fall. The investigative reporting prize went to "The Blade" of Toledo, Ohio, for its investigative series on atrocities by the elite U.S. Army unit, tiger force, during the Vietnam War. That series was featured on the NewsHour last Friday. In the arts, the biography winner was William Taubman for his book about Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev. General non-fiction went to Anne Applebaum for her history of the Soviet gulags. Edward P. Jones won the fiction category for "The Known World," a novel about slavery - Wright, the poetry prize for "Walking to Martha's Vineyard," Paul Moravec, the music prize for his "Tempest Fantasy," and for drama, Doug Wright for "I Am My own Wife." J.C. Penney sold its Eckerd drug store chain for more than $4.5 billion today. The U.S.-based CVS Corporation and a Canadian partner bought the chain of 2,800 Eckerd outlets in 23 states. The deal makes CVS the largest drug chain in the United States, with 5,000 stores. Bank of America will cut 12,500 jobs, or 7 percent, of its workforce. The announcement today follows completion of the bank's merger with the Fleet Boston Financial Corporation. The bank said it was trimming overlapping processes to save $650 million. It promised customers no reduction in services. On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 87 points to close at 10,558. The NASDAQ rose nearly 22 points to close at 2079. That's it for the News Summary tonight. Now it's on to our three-part look at the violence in Iraq, and the opening of baseball's steroids season. 

FOCUS - TURMOIL

JIM LEHRER: The new turmoil in Iraq. Part one: From on the ground, and to Margaret Warner. 

MARGARET WARNER: The violence that killed eight American soldiers and wounded more than three dozen yesterday, began with Shiite protests in several Iraqi cities. The protests turned particularly violent in the holy city of Najaf, and in Baghdad. The fiercest fighting was in Baghdad's largest Shiite neighborhood, known as Sadr City. It was there that the eight American soldiers were killed. Overall, about 50 Iraqis were killed and some 170 others wounded. The demonstrations throughout the country were spearheaded by militant followers of a 31-year- old radical Islamic cleric, Moqtada al Sadr. Yesterday's clashes followed protests last week over the coalition's decision to shut down al Sadr's newspaper, and the Saturday arrest of a top al Sadr's aide for alleged involvement in the murder of a rival cleric last year. Today, the U.S. Administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared alSadr an outlaw.

L. PAUL BREMER: He is effectively attempting to establish his authority in place of the legitimate authority of the Iraqi government and the coalition. And as I said yesterday, we will not tolerate this. We will reassert the law and order which the Iraqi people expect of the coalition and the Iraqi forces. 

MARGARET WARNER: Coalition authorities also disclosed today that an Iraqi judge had issued an arrest warrant for al-Sadr several months ago in connection with the rival cleric's murder. Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said the violence incited by al-Sadr's militia, the al Mahdi army, and other militias would not be tolerated. 

BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT: Militias are inconsistent with a democratic and sovereign nation with a central government. And we will take action, as and when necessary, to maintain a safe and secure environment in Iraq. Individuals who create violence, who incite violence, who execute violence against persons inside of Iraq will be hunted down and captured or killed. It is that simple.

MARGARET WARNER: Despite a show of force by coalition troops, new Shiite protests led by members of al-Sadr's al Mahdi militia erupted today in several Iraqi cities. 

And for the latest developments inside Iraq, we're joined from Baghdad by Jeffrey Gettleman of the "New York Times." 

Jeffrey, welcome. I gather you've been in a lot of these hot spots today. Give us a feeling for what it's like on the ground. 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Sure. Today I went to two places. I went to Fallujah in western Iraq, where right now the marines are dealing with an insurgency by Sunni Muslims. There was this horrible incident last week, where four people were killed, four American civilians were killed in the center of Fallujah, and their bodies were dragged through the streets. And today, the marines began to surround the city and plan a siege to find the people who were responsible for this attack, and try to restore some order in Fallujah. I did that today. And I also went to a city called Kufa in the South, which has been racked by violence where militia men loyal to a Shia cleric have taken over the town, kicked off the Iraqi police, and established their own occupation-free zone in the area where there's no coalition or occupation authorities, no Iraqi police, only these members of this militia who wear all black, carry machine guns and sort of rule the town as it is right now. 

MARGARET WARNER: And are they very much in evidence? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Yeah, they are. They're all over the place. I mean, what's going on is this one cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, is in a mosque right now, and he's refusing to come out. The coalition authorities have issued an arrest warrant for him because they say he's been behind this recent up-surgence in violence, and also that he had played a part in an assassination attempt on an assassination last year. So his followers have surrounded his mosque. They have a lot of guns, RPG's, which are rocket- propelled grenades, and they say that they're preparing for a siege by American forces when they come to take this cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr. 

MARGARET WARNER: Tell us a little more about yesterday. I mean, was al-Sadr able to just give the word and suddenly all these protests erupted in all these different cities? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Yesterday was really scary. It was the first time since I've been here-- I've been here about three months-- that there were really signs that things were slipping out of control. The day began with massive demonstration in many cities across Iraq, in Baghdad, in Najaf, Basra and a few other places. And they were organized by this cleric, al-Sadr, who is protesting two things, basically. One is the Americans shut down his newspaper last week. He publishes a weekly newspaper, the American authorities had accused it of printing lies that incited violence, and so they took action last week and closed the newspaper. That began the series of protests starting last week, that sort of built to through this past week. The second event was the arrest of one of al-Sadr's aides, who supposedly was linked to an assassination of a rival cleric last year. So there was a lot of energy in the street. This cleric, al-Sadr, was calling for his followers to protest these two things. Meanwhile, many of them are armed. And as the day went on yesterday, things got out of control. It started with stones being tossed in a few places, then there were gunshots, and then just sort of all-out mayhem erupted both here in Baghdad and in a few other places. 

MARGARET WARNER: How seriously have the U.S. forces and U.S. officials that you've talked to taken al-Sadr up till now, in terms of whether he has a big enough following, how powerful this militia of his is? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: I think the U.S. authorities have been watching him, as evidenced by shutting down his newspaper last week. They said that was a very difficult decision because they anticipated that it would provoke many of his followers to demonstrate in the streets, but they were very worried that if he continued to print this newspaper that contained lies according to the coalition. One example was that al-Sadr had accused the coalition of planning a suicide bombing or an attack against the police station that everybody else here in Iraq had basically thought was a suicide bombing. But they thought that if the paper continued it could really cause a problem. So they had been watching him, but I think more of the focus been on another Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, who is a much older man, he lives in Najaf, he issues these religious decrees. And Sistani was playing a much more active role in the governance of Iraq. So while there was a lot of focus on Sistani, Sadr was able to sort of create a following, build a militia, and yesterday we saw the results of that. 

MARGARET WARNER: Now, what do coalition officials say about, or how do they explain the fact that this arrest warrant apparently, which was disclosed today was issued for him months ago, but they've never arrested him? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: You know, they really didn't address that question. It came up, but there was no clear answer why if the arrest warrant had been issued month ago it was just coming out today, one day after al-Sadr had provoked what proved to be the greatest insurrection since occupation began. 

MARGARET WARNER: And U.S. officials-- and we've run some of this tape-- had some very tough talk about how they plan to crack down on these militias, they're not going to tolerate them. Anybody who is involved will be put out of business, and so on. What is their plan, really, for cracking down on all of these? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: It's really not clear. And like my visit to Kufa today showed, it's going to be a serious challenge. I mean, the town of Kufa, it's a small town along the banks of the Euphrates River, it's actually quite pretty, the river runs right through it, there are these palm trees lining each side, and there's this beautiful mosque in the middle. That's where al-Sadr is holed up right now. But he has the place so surrounded with his followers, who are so loyal to him, andalmost fanatical. You see them marching through the streets with these huge posters of al-Sadr, chanting his name. They all say that they'll die for him, and they've really dug in. So to uproot a militia like that, it's going to be mayhem. And there's a lot of people in Kufa today that I talked to that are sort of dreading what may happen if the U.S. troops come down there, or any troops come down there to try to take him out because they're so entrenched right now and the support for him is so loyal right there, that it's hard to imagine how this is going to be resolved without some serious fighting. 

MARGARET WARNER: And do U.S. Officials or coalition officials you talked to say they think they've got enough troops to handle all of this? 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Well, that's one of those questions that keeps coming up, and we keep getting the same answer. And that is yes, we do have enough troops to handle this. But part of that explanation was based on reassurances given by American authorities that the Iraqi police forces and security forces were ready to take on some of the day-to-day security. But what was really frightening about yesterday was that the Iraqi forces just collapsed, and Sadr City, where there was serious fighting going on, the Iraqi police fled and the Americans had to come in and battle these forces loyal to Sadr to get them out of the police stations they seized. In Kufa, there wasn't even a battle. As soon as the armed militia arrived at the doorsteps of the police station, the police left. So that seems to raise the question of how ready are the Iraqis right now to provide for their own security if there is a hand-over and the American forces play more of a secondary role. 

MARGARET WARNER: Jeffrey Gettleman, thanks so much. 

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Thank you. 

JIM LEHRER: Now, part two: More on the Shia leader, and to Gwen Ifill, 

GWEN IFILL: For more about the latest Shiite uprising, and what it means for the continuing occupation, we turn to Samer Shehata, a visiting assistant professor of Middle East politics at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown University; and Adeed Dawisha, professor of political science at Miami University of Ohio-- he's written extensively on the politics of the Middle East. 

Professor Shehata, we've heard about the general reluctance of the Shia population to this occupation and to the legal steps which are being put in place to, for the handover on June 30. What do we see over the weekend with this new uprising that tells us what effect that will have on the prospects for the handover? 

SAMER SHEHATA: Well, what we've seen is a Shia leader who has been the most vehement in his criticism of the occupation in his calling into question the legitimacy of the Iraqi governing council, someone who's been excluded from the political process -- not easily willing to go way or to succumb to the rule of the coalition provisional authority. It's not clear how powerful Sadr is, it's not clear how many people are in his militia as it were. But these are the types of difficulties that the CPA is going to face in the future because this isn't the only militia, it's not the only Islamist based militia either. 

GWEN IFILL: He is 30 years old, relatively new to any positions of leadership. But is he someone that the United States or the coalition provisional authority has been taking seriously?

SAMER SHEHATA: Not really. He is young, there's no question about that, and he's also politically inexperienced, which is not a very good combination. But he comes from a long lineage of Shia clerics who have a significant amount of standing in Iraq. His father was of course killed by Saddam Hussein or Saddam Hussein's agents, as well as two of Sadr's brothers. His father was also in prison for some time and has established a charitable network of welfare, education and other organizations that have real resonance in the kind of disenfranchised Shia community of Baghdad and beyond. But the United States has not been taking Sadr very seriously. 

GWEN IFILL: Adeed Dawisha, should they have been taking him seriously? 

ADEED DAWISHA: Well, it depends on what you mean by taking him seriously. They've been eying him very closely, and last fall, for example, when some of his people ambushed an American group and killed two or three Americans, the CPA actually went in and threatened him with imprisonment, and as a result of that in fact you find that for about September, October, up until very recently about a month ago his rhetoric had been toned down considerably. It's only in the last two or three weeks that he's kind of upped the ante again and began calling for violence against the Americans and insurrection, and that's when the Americans began to do something about it, or at least in a sense it began with closing down his newspaper, and imprisoning his main lieutenant. 

GWEN IFILL: Why the suddenly stepped up rhetoric? What was it that triggered that which led to this? 

ADEED DAWISHA: You know, it's very difficult to know why. I think that a lot of these groups, including his are now jockeying for power in anticipation of the transfer of power that the CPA is going to be doing, and in June. It also probably is a result of what's been happening in Fallujah, which has been creating an image of the Americans as being somewhat weak, unable to quell the insurrection in the town like Fallujah, and with these people, especially the -- Sadr and his group, any sign of weakness is immediately pounced upon. So I think that the events of the last month or so have had a major impact on the change in strategy of Sadr.

GWEN IFILL: And Professor Shehata, the events of the last month or so have been all centered in the Sunni Triangle -- the only concerns about the Shia population had been revolving around Ayatollah al Sistani, who is obviously, what is his relationship to al-Sadr, if any? 

SAMER SHEHATA: Well, it's not a very good one, it's a rival relationship really, over influence on the Shia majority in Iraq. Although publicly, Sistani has not said anything negatively against Sadr, Sadr has criticized al-Sistani and other religious leaders in Iraq who have been willing to engage in some kind of negotiations as it were with the coalition provisional authority and the Americans. So they can be seen as rival religious leaders, vying for the allegiance of Iraq's Shia population. 

GWEN IFILL: But rival on the same level? 

SAMER SHEHATA: Not at all, not on the same level. Sistani is revered, he is a man of religious learning, a scholar, he's reclusive; he's not somebody who has dirtied his hands in the day-to-day politics of Iraq. Moqtada al-Sadr is the opposite, he's young and inexperienced and has not had that much religious learning whatsoever. And his main appeal is his fiery anti-American, anti-occupation, nationalism really, a Shia nationalism that appeals to the most disenfranchised elements of the population.

GWEN IFILL: Professor Dawisha, Professor Shehata said he's not certain how many people that Mr. Al-Sadr actually controls. Do you have a sense of that, of who he's actually speaking to and whether it's potent? 

ADEEDDAWISHA: Well, I agree that his main support comes from the disenfranchised section of the Shiite community in Iraq, that's why you find the demonstrations for example in Baghdad coming out of Sadr City, which used to be called Saddam City, which is the worst slums in Iraq -- in Baghdad. Now on the other side of the city, there is an area which is also heavily Shiite, but this is the area of middle class merchants, professionals and so on, and so far nothing has come out of that area. That tells you something about the kind of support he has. In terms of militia, he controls, a militia called a Mahdi army which is probably about 10,000 men. These are all a bunch of, to be quite honest and to say it plainly, a bunch of thugs who go around these southern cities terrorizing women for not wearing the right clothes, terrorizing professors who are probably secular; in fact last week this Mahdi army went into a small village, which is inhabited by gypsies and because the gypsies in Iraq tend to kind of dance and sing, this village was entirely raised to the ground, and it's inhabitants of about a thousand or fifteen hundred were either killed or tortured. This is the kind of group that this man is presiding over. And this is why I think the CPA has finally decided to take him on. 

GWEN IFILL: Professor Shehata if there are 10,000 of them and they are thugs and they are organized thugs, what is it that the coalition provisional authority ought to be doing or the United States forces ought to be doing to silence them? 

SAMER SHEHATA: Well, this is the crucial question, because Moqtada al-Sadr might not be a problem, but how the U.S. deals with him and his militia is a crucial issue. I think that dealing with them as they have over the last couple of days with Apache helicopter gun ships, tanks and so on, my not be the best way to do that, because Moqtada al-Sadr could become a martyr. This could embitter a much larger segment of the Iraqi population against the United States. So I think that's really the key question. And it's not clear at all why this arrest warrant was issued right now if it - or why they're trying to arrest him right now, if the arrest warrant was issued sometime ago. So I think probably what's in the CPA's minds is this June 30 deadline and the desire to get rid of someone like Moqtada al-Sadr and the possible danger that he poses before the symbolic handover of power to a sovereign Iraqi authority. 

GWEN IFILL: Professor Dawisha, your thoughts on that, exactly what should the coalition provisional authority be doing if anything if he is that serious a threat? 

ADEED DAWISHA: I think the CPA at the moment is walking a very tight rope, and I hope they will come to the right conclusions about what to do. On the one hand, the kind of people al-Sadr leads and he himself, they're not the kind of people who in a sense understand compromise. Any compromise on the part of the CPA is seen as a sign of weakness and will only engender even more violence on their part. On the other hand, if, I agree whole heartedly with Professor Shehata, if you make a Sadr into a martyr, then whatever support he has might overspill into the larger Shiite community, and then if we're going to have --the a large segment of the Shiite community against us as well as the Sunni Triangle, then we are having a major problem on our hands. So we need to use -- sorry. 

GWEN IFILL: But in your opinion, should he be removed, is he a serious enough threat or can he just be set to the side and ignored? 

ADEED DAWISHA: I think if we can remove him while at the same time appealing to the grand ayatollah's Sistani -- the people who have a lot of influence amongst the larger Shiite community, if we can bring them in and don't forget these people detest Moqtada al-Sadr; they would be very happy to see him go. If we can do this kind of stick and carrot policy, then we might get away with it. But if we just leave him untouched, then he's just going to continue, because he's going to see this as a sign of weakness on our part and that's something which he plays on. 

GWEN IFILL: Adeed Dawisha and Samer Shehata, thank you for joining us. 

JIM LEHRER: And now, part three of our Iraq violence focus with the two leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: The chairman, Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana; and the ranking Democrat Joe Biden of Delaware. 

Senator Lugar, the president today rejected delaying the June or considering delaying the June 30 deadline for turning over sovereignty to Iraq. Do you agree with him? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Well, I was asked a question yesterday by a reporter about the 30th deadline and it appeared to me that this might be a subject for more study and more debate. And certainly the program you've had this evening illustrates some of the reasons why, namely the time frame is very small to disarm the militia, to bring about a security situation in which the governing council, the 24 Iraqis or however many others they appoint, can govern the country. And furthermore, I added that over here on the Senate, at some point we hope to see a nominee for ambassador of the country, a very important appointment, and have the confirmation process, learn more about the 3,000 Americans who may be going to the largest embassy we've ever had before the 30th of June and try to figure out the security for those Americans quite apart from those folks who are out there now: Humanitarian people, construction Americans, trying to help the Iraqis rebuild their country.

JIM LEHRER: But Senator, it was your statement that caused the president to be asked this very question today. 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Yes.

JIM LEHRER: Do you interpret his answer assaying no way, Senator Lugar? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: That's my impression. That the president gave that answer, that June 30 is it, is the deadline. Now if this be the case, then I'm very hopeful that who ever is doing the planning for the next few days as we count down to June 30, will come forward, at least to some of us in the Congress, I think that they probably in the administration will need some of our assistance in a time in which the Congress has been polarized, is fractious, as the president and others have observed. We're going to need at least some idea, which we used to get daily when the war was going on, the hostilities in Iraq. But now whole weeks pass without any sign really of how things are proceeding. So we're going to have hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on the 20th, the 21st and 22nd of this month, we are going to probe anybody who will tell us what ought to occur in Iraq, or what is occurring. 

JIM LEHRER: Senator Biden, how do you read the president's statement today, same way Senator Lugar does? 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: The exact same way Senator Lugar does, and quite frankly I think whether or not we go forward on June 30 is actually less important than whether we have a plan for success. I don't know what the administration's plan is. I don't know what the plan is as when Bremer says wheels up on June 30, what happens then, to whom are we turning over sovereignty, number one. Number two, who is going tobe the referee, there's no doubt there's going to be some degree of chaos between June 30 and the time general elections are to be held at the end of January. Who is going to be the one that lets, if in fact Chalabi makes a deal with Sistani on diminishing the role of women in Iraq, for example, who is going to demarche them just like we did in Afghanistan when they - when the Loyah Jirga were putting together their constitution and they diverted in a significant way? I just don't know what the plan is, and it is absolutely incredible me that here we are about twelve weeks out, neither the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee nor the ranking member, not that we're so important, but institutionally we in a sense are, at least I don't have any idea what their plan is. 

JIM LEHRER: What about the president's point today, Senator Biden, that the U.S. has an obligation to the Iraqi people to keep its word? The word was we're going to turn it over on June 30. Yes, there's some security problems, yes the U.S. is going to have to keep troops there. 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: The answer is there's some truth to that. The president for whatever reason picking June 30 has raised expectations considerably. And there's two concerns about not being able to turn power over at that time: One would be that we have reneged on our word to the Iraqi populous at large. But the second is that is Sadr and his thugs or the Sunni Triangle folks in Fallujah conclude that their activity can alter our course of action -- that they are succeeding. So I acknowledge that there is a real concern. There is still time to do this the right way, in my view. But I just am at a loss to be able to understand why there hasn't been a resolution within the administration as to whether or not they're going to go back for another U. N. resolution, whether or not they're going to try to get a Brahimi like figure in --. 

JIM LEHRER: The U.N. special --

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: The U. N. special envoy, essentially a high commissioner. In other words, I just don't know what they have in mind. And as Dick said, during the war, prior to the war they consulted with us regularly. As if, and they're acting now like as if there's no need to consult us, as if they don't need congressional support. And I think it's less important that they satisfy Dick and me than they satisfy the American people. And I think the American people are beginning to wonder whether they have a plan for success. 

JIM LEHRER: Do you agree with that, Senator Lugar, the American people are wondering what going on over there? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Yes, they are wondering and we need to offer answers. 

JIM LEHRER: We meaning the entire U.S. Government, you all included as well as the president? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: That's right - the president and Congress. And we need to see it together, so that it is even more credible. I would just add to what Joe Biden has said that clearly if I were a member of the governing council of 24 and sovereignty was passed to me, sometimes it's said symbolically, but the Iraqis believe it's actually, and at that point the Iraqis have virtually no army, the police forces are very small and some are being trained as we've just heard, they flee when there is conflict in the cities of Iraq. If I were a member of that governing council I would wonder how do I plan to govern? The old idea is not to worry, the United States will be there. But then the idea that we're going to have an agreement with this new government prior to June 30 has been put aside, and people have said in Iraq, you can't do that prior to our taking sovereignty. Then we'll make an arrangement with the United States for the troops. This is an entirely unsatisfactory, watching what we have been watching in the last few days. 

JIM LEHRER: Back to the rock and the hard place issue that Senator Biden raised, that if the United States for whatever reason does not meet its obligation or meet its promise on June 30, then the al-Sadrs and the other thugs in Iraq will have won. Is that a problem in and of itself? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Of course it's a problem. And I would just say that talking about the June 30 deadline is a difficult issue because of the promise that June 30 is it. But once again the Iraqi governing council is a group that is to receive the sovereignty, they're the group that supposedly will work out the road map of how they get a constitution, how they have executive persons there, how finally the elections might be held. And in order to do any of that, they're going to have to have some security around themselves. We're going to transfer authority essentially from the Pentagon to the State Department on June 30. Jerry Bremer leaves and an ambassador still to be named and confirmed and all the people to come in. This is a huge change in a very insecure situation. And all I'm saying is that we do need a road map of our own, that is the congress, the American people, to follow what kind of sacrifice, what kind of money, extra troops if that is required, or whatever, so that we are successful. 

JIM LEHRER: Senator Biden, extra troops, that issue came up today in a joint press availability in Baghdad with Paul Bremer, and they said that no extra troops were needed, but always looking at that as an issue. What do you think, where do you come down on that? 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: It's a very unpopular position I've been taking, I've been take it for the last five months, we don't have enough troops there. The idea that you hear Bremer and others and they're good people say that we've trained up 200,000 Iraqi security forces from their civil guard to their police to their army is absolutely preposterous. When Dick Lugar and I were there over a year ago almost now, we met with all our trainers, they say it's going to take at least three years to train up an Iraqi police force, it's going to take that long or longer to train an Iraqi army. The truth of the matter is there is no security but U.S. security, a few Brits, a few Spaniards and a few Poles. It is the United States of America. 

JIM LEHRER: And that's not going to change on June 30, right? 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: It's not going to change, it just going to get worse, so we are the game, we are the totality of the security. And it seems to me we're not leveling with the American people here. This can be done, but remember, we made the announcement as far back as late November of last year to June 30 was the date. Here we are, in April, and they still haven't resolved the dispute in the administration between the State Department and the vice president's office or who ever else is arguing about this as to what is the plan. 

JIM LEHRER: Senator Lugar, is that the problem here, that the administration can't get its own disagreements sorted out? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: I don't know; I frankly don't know. I've asked this quietly, for a while, would you having any resolution of it. So as I've mentioned to you publicly - we're going to raise these in a couple of weeks and hopefully in that period of time the administration will have plans that it can give to the public and to us and then we can then movemore confidently. 

JIM LEHRER: Do you agree with Senator Biden, he said it twice now, that it can be done probably by June 30? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Yes, I think we need to focus on success. The purpose of the conversation of Joe Biden and Dick Lugar on these issues is that we have been stalwarts in a bipartisan way for the president throughout this entire period of time. We're not harping critics, attempting to cause difficulty either publicly or privately. We want success, the president wants success. We're going to have to begin to pull together and talk to each other, and the American people need to hear that conversation. 

JIM LEHRER: Senator Biden, have you made efforts to tell the people in the administration what you all have just been saying here tonight? 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: Absolutely I have. As a matter of fact --. 

JIM LEHRER: Who do you talk to? 

SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, to Dr. Rice, I talked to the secretary of state, and deputy secretary. But they're very empathetic and sympathetic. I've tried to talk to the president. I came back from a long meeting with President Chirac, meeting with the heads of all our NATO allies, the so-called permanent representatives in Brussels, I came back and I said this is what, and I wrote a report, I asked for five minutes to be able to see the president, he was not able to see me,. In the past, on the run up to the war, Dick Lugar and I and rights after the war were in his office frequently. I don't often ask to see the president of the United States, it's not that I'm so important, I wanted a report to the president on what was being said in Europe, what possibilities existed in my view, so we heard another point of view. And he wrote me a very nice handwritten letter saying Condi will be in touch. She called me and said I got your memo, got your note, thank you very much. So now maybe you're talking to somebody, Jim, look, Jim, if they have, if there isn't a division within the administration, about what the plan should be, then that means there is a plan and they're not telling us. Why? I don't get it. I mean, I truly do not get this. 

JIM LEHRER: So, Senator Lugar, same question. Have you been trying very hard also to say the same thing and who have you been talking to? Because it's unusual, both of you have said it several times now, hey, you were definitely in the loop up until recently, why are you no longer in the loop, have you asked people that question? 

SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: No, I've not asked. My own supposition is that essentially there is indecision right now as to the questions that we're raising would be answered. And probably at least some inner circle talk within the administration that they're not prepared really to share, and as far as their concerned, essentially they would say the administration is running this war or running the piece, we are interesting people and in due course if we can be brought together in some sort of alliance that would be useful, but for the moment not a priority.

JIM LEHRER: All right. Senators both, thank you very much. 

FOCUS - OUT AT THE OLD BALLGAME

JIM LEHRER: And finally tonight, baseball begins a new season facing some tough questions. Terence smith has that. 

SPOKESMAN: Into left center field. He's going to... 

TERENCE SMITH: Baseball's new season got under way at ball parks across the country today, with many fans and players braving cold and windy weather. President Bush told reporters he had a strategy for the ceremonial first pitch. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: I'm going straight fastball today. Try to get a little hop on it. 

TERENCE SMITH: And then later in St. Louis, he put his arm to the test, and opened the Cardinals' season. This year, the cloud of steroid use looms large over baseball. Last season, nearly 1,200 ballplayers underwent anonymous, penalty-free testing for steroids as part of the league's new drug policy. Between 5 percent and 7 percent came back positive -- enough to staff about three teams. Baseball's drug policy is less stringent than other sports. While a player can be fined and even temporarily suspended, no player can be suspended for a full season until his fifth offense. One San Francisco lab, Balco, is under heavy scrutiny for its alleged role in a scheme to distribute illegal steroids to professional athletes. Four people were indicted by a federal grand jury, including Balco's founder and the personal trainer to home run champion Barry Bonds. During the off season, President Bush raised the issue in his state of the union address. And at a hearing in Washington last month, Republican Senator John McCain put the pressure on Major League players and owners to change their ways. 

SEN. JOHN McCAIN: Your failure to commit to addressing this issue straight on, and immediately, will motivate this committee to search for legislative remedies. I don't know what they are, but I can tell you and your players that you represent the status quo is not acceptable. 

TERENCE SMITH: For his part, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has acknowledged the problem in recent weeks, including yesterday on ABC's "This Week." 

BUD SELIG: We need, in my opinion, is random testing year round. We also need stiffer penalties. We need a program, as I said earlier, like the one that's in the minor leagues because that will forever remove the cloud. George, this is not only a health issue. There's no question about that. But it's also it's an integrity issue. There's a whole series of things that we really have to deal with. 

TERENCE SMITH: The players union has resisted calls for random drug testing, citing concerns over the players' privacy. For more, I'm joined by Buster Olney, a senior writer at "ESPN," the magazine, and a longtime baseball beat reporter. 

Buster Olney, welcome. 

Tell us, as this season opens, just how widespread a problem is this? I mean, we mentioned those tests last year that suggested five to seven percent. Is that the dimension or is it in fact larger? 

BUSTER OLNEY: I think players think it's much larger than that. The five to seven percent that tested positive last year, those were tests that players could reasonably predict when they were going to take place. I think when you talk to players privately they think it's probably about a third of the players, a couple years ago were taking it and maybe half of those because they're feeling pressure to keep up with their competitors. 

TERENCE SMITH: What does that do to baseball, if that's the case, then it really is very widespread and as Commissioner Selig said, it's on one hand a health issue and on the other hand an integrity of the game issue. What does that do to baseball? 

BUSTER OLNEY: It really puts it in a bind. They just, because the labor agreement is only two years old, and this is only the second year of testing, they're kind of locked into the current program unless the union leadership changes its stance, and I don't know if that's going to happen. The players internally within the union, I think, the vast majority of them want a more stronger testing program, but the union leadership I don't think wants to give away this issue when they're not in a situation where they're negotiating a new contract with the owners. 

TERENCE SMITH: Well, break that down for us. You say the players want it. But the union is resisting it or treats it as a negotiating bargaining chip. That seems almost contradictory. 

BUSTER OLNEY: Well, a couple years ago U.S.A. Today did a poll of players and they polled about 550 of 750 players, and 79 percent of the players in a private poll said that they preferred a strong testing system. I think most of the players look at steroid users as a threat to the others, competitively, financially, because they're taking jobs away from players who are not using it, and they don't know what the risks are health-wise. And they're I think a little worried about if I use this stuff what's going to happen to me in ten years, as one player said to me in spring, I have to wonder if I'm going to be able to see my children go through their weddings. That's a difficult situation for the players. On the other hand, the union leadership has always taken the public stance that this is a privacy issue for the players, they don't want players to have to submit to random drug tests, not only for steroids, but information other drugs. They feel like that's an infringement upon the players. But I also think that because they are not currently negotiating a contract, this is an issue they don't want to give away for free. 

TERENCE SMITH: You mentioned you were at spring training, and I wonder what you heard there, whether players talked about possibly using steroids and now getting off it? Did you see any evidence of that? 

BUSTER OLNEY: There is, there are a lot of executive scouts you talk to and looking at the players because this is the first year where a player can be suspended for steroid use, the bodies are definitely smaller, were definitely smaller around spring training, you look around baseball, you can see the effect that the testing is having on it. The question is whether or not because they're not strong penalties, is this going to be a lasting effect. Most of the players don't think so. The players who want stronger testing think the current system is a joke. You basically, since the beginning of last year, you could have stood in the middle of the clubhouse, taken steroids in front of every reporter, every teammate four times and before you were actually subject to suspension. 

TERENCE SMITH: Right, and it wasn't actually grounds for that sort of action at that point. What about the owners? When you talk to them, when you interview them, what level of concern and if they reflect Commissioner Selig's opinion that there ought to be widespread random testing and a real program here, why does it happen? 

BUSTER OLNEY: Well, one of the owners said to me last year the baseball moves like a dread naught. It takes a very long time to change direction. There are a lot of indications in the mid 90s when you looked at how bodies were changing that steroids was becoming a growing problem in baseball, and yet it really hasn't been until the last couple years in which the owners stepped in to address the problem and not until the last few weeks when the owners have been particularly loud about addressing this issue. My own feeling is that Commissioner Selig, he knows which way the wind is blowing on this, and he knows essentially it's a situation where the union is going to have to address this before he can. 

TERENCE SMITH: Meanwhile of course we're getting records broken year after year: Homerun records, pitching is stronger and more frequent. I wonder what you think of that as a development and whether you attribute it to steroid use on the first level, and secondly, if so, whether the whole era, the steroid era if you want to call it that, needs to have an asterisk attached to it. 

BUSTER OLNEY: Well, I don't think you can attach something like that to the era simply because you can't prove whether or not a player used it. I have no doubt that steroids have had a huge impact, and not only on the hitters. There's an assumption that because hitters can gain a tangible result getting stronger that they are the ones who use it. A lot of pitchers are using this stuff. I presumably looking at the bodies and from talking with the players. It's because they can in taking steroids they can bounce back from pitching in a game much more quickly if they use the steroids. And you look around at some of the pitchers who have been very successful in recent years, and there's a lot of suspicion about whether or not they use steroids. It has been a huge factor in baseball, again, since the mid 90s. 

TERENCE SMITH: And you as someone mo watches baseball all the time and is up close to the players, you can actually physically see the difference, you can see that they're more muscular, more built up, as a result of what you assume is steroid use? 

BUSTER OLNEY: No question. And suddenly the bodies look like they have helium in them, the upper bodies, the foreheads squared off, you hear stories about how players capsizes are changing after they turn 30 years old. I walked up to a player last spring, and I could not believe the difference in him physically, and I thought he was embarrassed. He would never acknowledge to me that he used steroids, but you could see it in his eye, he was in a position where he felt like he needed to take this to keep up with other players who were using and it was unbelievable to see the difference in his arms, shoulders and in his forehead. 

TERENCE SMITH: One of the older players who hold those records, the Hall of Famers, when you talk to them, what do they say about this? 

BUSTER OLNEY: I think there's a quiet resentment, and more players, more Hall of Fame players, more star players are speaking out on this. Jim Palmer spoke out on it, was the Hall of Fame pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, talked about it a couple weeks ago, just yesterday Cecil Fielder, who became the first player in about 50 years did 50 homeruns, he basically suggested, he mentioned by name players who he thought were taking steroids. They feel like that their records, their accomplishments have lost the context that they should have because the numbers are being put up by suspected steroid users. 

TERENCE SMITH: Clearly a lot of people think it needs more looking into. Buster Olney, thank you very much. 

BUSTER OLNEY: Thank you. 

RECAP

JIM LEHRER: Again, the major developments of the day. U.S.-led forces struck back against the armed resistance by Shiite militias in Iraq. And President Bush said the June 30 transfer of power in Iraq would stick, despite the recent violence. 

JIM LEHRER: And again, to our honor roll of American service personnel killed in Iraq. We add them as their deaths are made official and photographs become available. Here, in silence, are 11 more. 

JIM LEHRER: We'll see you online, and again here tomorrow evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
