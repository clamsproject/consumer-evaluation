Intro

ROBERT MacNEIL: Good evening. These were the top headline stories today. President Reagan considered ways to increase the pressure on the captors of 40 American hostages, including a blockade of Lebanon. Syria and Israel offered to help in the crisis. House and Senate negotiators gave up efforts to reach a compromise agreement on a budget to reduce the deficit. An Oklahoma fireworks plant exploded, killing at least 21. Jim?

JIM LEHRER: The NewsHour tonight is the news of the day, two focus segments and a newsmaker interview. Focus one, President Reagan's options against Lebanon, first with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Richard Lugar, then with Jesse Jackson, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former State Department official Joseph Sisco. Focus two, the falling out of House and Senate conferees over the budget, with two of the principal players, Congressman William Gray and Senator William Armstrong. The newsmaker interview is with Senator Robert Packwood, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a key man in the move for tax reform.News Summary

LEHRER: President Reagan has decided to let diplomacy work a while longer to free the 40 American hostages in Beirut. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said late today the President is considering several concrete options, but decided to hold back to see if diplomatic efforts will work. Speakes said the options include shutting down the flow of goods and services into Lebanon through boycotts and other economic measures, and closing down Beirut airport to all traffic. Both of these steps, he said, would require cooperation of other countries; the point of it all would be to put pressure on the Shiite Moslems to release the hostages. Mr. Reagan met today with his top diplomatic, military and intelligence advisers, including Secretary of State Shultz and Defense Secretary Weinberger. Robin?

MacNEIL: There were these other developments in the hostage crisis today. White House spokesman Speakes said Syria had agreed to help, but Washington had seen no evidence of it. Israel's Prime Minister Shimon Peres sent a letter to President Reagan pledging full cooperation. Previously Israel has expressed sympathy, but said the situation is an American affair. United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a statement calling for the early release of the 735 Lebanese prisoners still held by Israel. The International Red Cross says it was visiting all 40 hostages today in Beirut.

LEHRER: We will take a long look at the hostage situation in our lead focus segment tonight.

In El Salvador today there was a follow-up to last week's killing of four U.S. Marines. A leftist guerrilla group said the raid was only the beginning of a war against American servicemen in El Salvador. The off-duty Marines had been assigned to the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. They were shot while eating at an outdoor cafe.

MacNEIL: House and Senate conferees today gave up for the time being their efforts to find a compromise budget to cut the federal deficit. They were unable to reconcile differences between the Republican Senate budget plan, which cuts Social Security cost-of-living increases, and the Democratic House plan, which leaves the COLAs intact, but makes deeper cuts in defense. The impasse was described by Senate Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici.

Sen. PETE DOMENICI, (R) New Mexico, chairman, Budget Committee: I have concluded that no good purpose can be served in continuing this conference at this time. Knowing full well the importance of a major deficit reduction package, I have, nonetheless, concluded that we should no longer proceed. I don't want this to be interpreted in any way that the House conferees, and in particular the distinguished chairman of the House conference, have not tried their very best. It's just one of those situation where now that, consistent with the confines of these two budget resolutions, there seems to the senator from New Mexico, chairman of this conference and the chairman of the Senate conferees, that no useful purpose will be served, with the situation being what it is, for us to proceed.

MacNEIL: We'll discuss the budget deadlock in a focus section later in the program when we also have a newsmaker interview on the shape of tax reform with Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert Packwood.

LEHRER: More than 20 people died today in a series of explosions at an Oklahoma fireworks factory. Thirty-one people were in the factory's five buildings at the time; three of the five buildings were demolished. There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosions, which were felt nearly 15 miles away. An Oklahoma highway patrolman described the scene.

Lt. JIM KING, Oklahoma Highway Patrol: We found bodies out into the woods and what have you, so it was a massive explosion. We still have some magazines over the hill that are still live and are capable of going off. We have the fire department here and the sheriff's helping us and we've got other towns around that are helping us secure the area so we can make sure it is safe.

REPORTER: Lieutenant King, didn't this same place blow up about six years ago?

Lt. KING: Yes, sir, it did.

REPORTER: Same company?

Lt. KING: Yes, sir, as far as I know.

LEHRER: The fireworks company is named the Aerlex Corporation. Their factory is near Hallett, Oklahoma, a town of 200, 40 miles west of Tulsa.

And the situation in Anaheim, California, has turned more dangerous. Toxic fumes have been pouring from an agriculture warehouse fire there since Saturday. Ten people, including one fireman, have been treated for injuries, and 9,000 people have evacuated their homes in the area. Spokesmen said potentially explosive chemicals remain in the warehouse. Here is a further report by Marika Gerard of L.A. News, an independent service.

MARIKA GERARD, L.A. News [voice-over]: The fire started late Saturday night in the Larry Fricker Company, a pesticide and herbicide warehouse in Orange County. Because of the potential danger from toxic fumes, 2,000 people were initially asked to leave nearby homes while firefighters fought the blaze. However, by Monday, as the chemicals continued to smoulder, the evacuation area was doubled. Firefighters first thought they were dealing with only a few potentially dangerous chemicals, but now believe there may be as many as 80 chemicals housed in the building, including highly flammable ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate compounds. So far there have been no serious injuries as a result of the fire. Although many evacuees have complained of sore throats and itchy eyes, very few have been treated. Today an extra U.S. Coast Guard strike team has arrived from San Francisco to help county firefighters neutralize the smouldering chemicals. Officials say it could be as many as two or three days before evacuated residents will be allowed back in their homes.

MacNEIL: Investigators said today that wreckage from the Air India plane which crashed on Sunday showed the 747 broke up in the air, but it was too early to say if it was blown up. Meanwhile, searchers scaled down the hunt for bodies. Of the 329 people aboard, the bodies of 131 have been recovered from the Atlantic west of Ireland. Here's a report from Kate Adie of Visnews.

KATE ADIE, Visnews [voice-over]: The intensive air search over, helicopters have been on standby to help with the more specialized hunt for the flight recorder. Early today a Chinook headed out to sea carrying technical and electronics personnel who will be attempting to wrest some information from below the sea's surface. The Royal Navy's Challenge few hints of the jumbo visible occasionally. The Irish have fishery protection vessels crisscrossing the designated area, and there's still more equipment being brought in for what has to be a very long shot at discovering the relevant part of the plane. No bodies have been located for over 24 hours, and the sea will have dispersed the wreckage to an extent that the Irish authorities have asked for a lookout to be kept on the shores of Britain, France and even Spain.

MacNEIL: Air India suspended service to Canada, where the doomed flight originated, demanding tighter airport security there. Authorities in India, Japan, Canada and Britain are investigating two Sikh fugitives who might be linked with the Air India disaster and a bomb explosion at Tokyo airport. The bomb was in luggage which had arrived on a Canadian Pacific plane from Vancouver. Two Sikhs, Lal Singh and Ammand Singh, booked tickets on that flight to Tokyo. One canceled his booking. Two men of the same name are wanted in the United States on charges of plotting to assassinate Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

LEHRER: The U.S. Transportation Department is sending President Reagan a list of ways to improve airline security in this country. A department spokesman said the list includes placing armed air marshals aboard planes flying the most threatened routes, better anti-terrorist training for airline crews, and accelerated research and development of explosive detection devices. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he thought the President would certainly approve the measures.

MacNEIL: In economic news today Japan announced it was cutting or ending import tariffs on more than 1,800 items, and promised more measures next month. Prime Minister Nakasone, who has urged greater Japanese imports to lessen the huge trade imbalance, particularly with this country, commented, "I hope foreign governments appreciate our efforts."

The U.S. government reported today that orders for large manufactured goods rose 4.1 in May, propelled mainly by a big increase in orders for military hardware. Commerce Secretary Baldrige said the gain offsets most of the recent setbacks.

And IBM, the world's biggest computer company, said it's buying a 30 share of MCI Communications. Flight 847: Weighing Action

LEHRER: We look first tonight at the latest in the TWA hostage crisis, now in its 12th day. President Reagan, said his spokesman, Larry Speakes, late this afternoon, is considering several options aimed at freeing the 40 Americans being held by Shiite Moslem terrorists. Those actions include trying to close down the Beirut airport to all air traffic and an economic boycott of Lebanon. Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was extensively briefed by Secretary of State Shultz on the options available to the President. He met at the White House today with President Reagan as well.

Senator Lugar, why the decision to hold back for now?

Sen. RICHARD LUGAR: Well, I think that we are still involved essentially in the negotiation mode. We're working with other countries that are friendly, some that are perhaps not so friendly. We attempt to explore with Israel all the ways we can cooperate with that very friendly government. There are a lot of options the President could adopt, and I think this was a good day for sharing with congressional leadership and with others how we might proceed.

LEHRER: Is one of the key diplomatic options being pursued is a way to get Israel to release the 700 Shiites they're holding?

Sen. LUGAR: No, our position remains the same, and I think it needs to be insistently commented on. We're not going to negotiate with terrorists, we're not going to insist that Israel bow to terrorists. The prime minister of Israel, Shimon Peres, pointed out in interviews on Sunday that eight different hijackings have already afflicted Israel. He has been involved in negotiating for the release of Israelis three times. He's an old hand at this type of experience. He's in good touch with George Shultz, our secretary of state, and our ties are of that nature, not ones of pressure.

LEHRER: Well, then what kind of negotiation -- what is there to negotiate about and with whom?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, we believe that the predicament of those who are holding our hostages is not necessarily secure. We think that there are potential arguments or pressures that could be brought to bear that would make a difference for them. We're attempting to explore each one of those and it seems to me that the impression that everyone ought to have, they ought to have correctly, is that this President is at his post, so is the secretary of state, Mr. McFarlane and the others, in good touch with congressional supporters and, as a matter of fact, in a bipartisan sense with the leadership. And we're prepared steadily, day after day, to explore every option.

LEHRER: Well, Senator, you probably know more than anybody in the Congress right now as we speak about what is going on. Do you have any particular reason to be optimistic?

Sen. LUGAR: Oh, I'm always optimistic in the sense that I believe essentially the things we are doing are right. We believe in the sanctity of life and the freedom of human beings. We believe that a majority of nations share that point of view, and we have a lot going for us in terms of our idealism, in terms of our track record. I think we have to be optimistic about that. I think, secondly, we are a great power. We're working with other great powers. We have, it seems to me, many more options and much more political stability than do the people with whom we're contending.

LEHRER: In other words, there are things going on that make you feel hopeful that this thing is going to be resolved fairly quickly?

Sen. LUGAR: Yes, there are. And, as a matter of fact, the President today in his meeting with bipartisan leadership of course gave an opportunity for Mr. McFarlane to brief us all, to give us the parameters of what we might be doing. But we also discussed the need to move to cut the budget deficit, to have a tax bill and reform, to get the appropriations on track. This is the government that is operating. I would think perhaps the hostage crisis has brought us together with much more intensity, with maybe more urgency with regard to the requirements for successful governance of this country.

LEHRER: The options on the Lebanon crisis, if diplomacy does not work. Did the President indicate to you how long he's going to let these diplomatic avenues run their course before he takes any further action?

Sen. LUGAR: No, the President has not made a decision on that, and I don't think that he ought to. I think his role is to explore each of the avenues and to continue applying pressure, continue trying out new situations. There is no particular reason we ought to signal what day and what hour we believe something ought to come into play. I think we are required, however, to set the stage for our allies or for even nations that are not too friendly, for the American people to understand various options, so that when and if the time comes that the President asks for cooperation he receives it. You know, for example, the other evening he suggested that it would not be advisable to fly into Greece in the same numbers that we had been doing. Some Americans observed that that was probably right. Others said, "We've got vacations and plans and we're going about life as usual." We're going to have to come into a different mode, I think, of public cooperation in this country, and I think the President is wisely setting the stage for that.

LEHRER: What's your own view of an economic boycott of Lebanon as a way to go?

Sen. LUGAR: I think it entirely depends upon the specifics, and I think these will be carefully drafted as potential options that Lebanon -- 

LEHRER: How would it be done, Senator?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, I suspect that through the cooperation of the nations that are involved in trading with Lebanon. Some would cooperate, hopefully; some might not. But Lebanon is a country with great difficulties. I think we have to assume that some of the Lebanese factions are not that keen on the Shiite Moslems to begin with, that there could in fact be some pressure internally within Lebanon to deal with the rest of the world.

LEHRER: Same on closing the Beirut airport to all airline traffic?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, that would be a more substantial step. Secretary Shultz has pointed out that 15 of all hijackings in recent times have occurred in or out of the Beirut airport. We had a continual amount of terrorism sort of originating in that situation. That may not be the only airport in the world that needs attention, but that certainly is one and that would make a difference.

LEHRER: How would we close it down, sir? How could the United States close it down?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, there are means of doing that, and I really don't want to get into the tactics, but I think the overall situtaion is one that is fully within our power.

LEHRER: There was a report on CNN late today that one of the options was to bomb the airport closed. Is that being seriously considered?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, I think that that would be a very serious step. I think the options the President discussed, at least publicly today, are ones that do not require that violence or potential loss of life. The President is operating in a very humane and, it seems to me, careful, prudent manner.

LEHRER: Senator, thank you. Robin?

MacNEIL: We discuss the President's actions and further options now with three Americans with different experience and perspectives. Joining us at public station WTTW-Chicago are Donald Rumsfeld, President Ford's secretary of defense and for a while a special Middle East representative for President Reagan; and Joseph Sisco, undersecretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Here in New York is Jesse Jackson, whose contacts with Syria secured the release of a captured Navy pilot during the U.S. involvement in Lebanon.

Starting with you, Joseph Sisco, how do you react to the course that Senator Lugar has outlined, the course of action Senator Lugar has outlined?

JOSEPH SISCO: Well, the President underscored in his press conference that he's going to explore every diplomatic avenue. I think we've got to continue on this course of action. If there are some modest points of pressure that can be applied, it might be helpful, but it seems to me that we're committed to a course of working through Nabih Berri. The Syrians have very considerable influence in Lebanon, and you could make a case that from the point of view of their national interests they could be helpful. Whether they will or not, I think this has to be tested, as well as a number of other countries that have influence in this situation. I think for the time being the President is right in pursuing all of these diplomatic avenues.

MacNEIL: What do you think, Donald Rumsfeld?

DONALD RUMSFELD: My personal view is that the President is correct in making a judgment that it would be harmful to the United States and the people of the United States to yield to the terrorists. I think what's important is that we come out of this incident, this circumstance, this terribly tragic situation, with a broadly accepted anti-terrorist policy for the United States of America. The fact of the matter is that the purpose of terrorism is to terrorize. It's also true that there are states that sponsor it, that facilitate it and that tolerate it. And it strikes me that it's time for the international community to make lepers of those nations and impose political-economic sanctions on them. I also think it's time for the United States to provide the American people the reasonable level of intelligence-gathering capability that they ought to expect, and to train and equip and exercise and deploy military capabilities so that on selective occasions they'll be available for pre-emption in the event intelligence information permits that, rescue where it's appropriate and, in other instances, retaliation where that may be appropriate.

MacNEIL: Jesse Jackson, how do you react to the course that you just heard Senator Lugar outline the President's going to take?

JESSE JACKSON: Well, if the object is to save American lives, we ought to pursue the course of negotiations over and against any kind of military option. A military option would most certainly -- a) we'd be killing innocent people there and most assuredly get the Americans killed. And so if the object is saving their lives, then the process of negotiation ought to continue. We ought to quit playing a game suggesting that we are not negotiating. We are not negotiating directly, perhaps, but we are negotiating through third parties, hoping that Israel on the one hand can help us by closing the window on the earlier release than they had planned of the hostages because there is linkage between the hostages and those who are being detained in Israel. On the other hand, making an even broader appeal to Syria to become even more involved because the reality is Syria is a key factor in this situation. Among other things, they occupy at least 70 of Lebanon and perhaps influence it all. So I would hope if we're going to pursue the route of negotiations that our language and rhetoric style is that of that kind of an appeal and reaching out. And if there is any military contingency plan, it ought not be overt and threatening. In other words, the hijackers did not threaten and have a press conference. They acted and then had a press conference. So if we're going to pursue negotiations, let's pursue that route, but let's not jeopardize those who are there now by giving the appearance of a threat.

MacNEIL: What do you think we should be doing with Israel, first, before we move on to Syria?

Rev. JACKSON: Well, first of all, it's certain the President did say that the holding of the detainees there is against international law, and that was a rather major statement for the President to make. On the other hand, the holding of the American hostages is against international law, and that's why some pursuit of a mutual exchange is significant. You must appreciate the fact that as long as those detainees remain in Israel, the less secure it makes Israel as opposed to more secure. It's costing money, it's costing politics, it's creating a greater target. So we ought to be in a mode of encouraging an early mutual release.

MacNEIL: What do you think of that, Joe Sisco, that we should be increasing the pressure on Israel to get those detainees out?

Sec. SISCO: My own feeling is that if an understanding can be achieved, that the question of the release of the detainees is not going to be the prime obstacle in the situation. Equally important is whether Nabih Berri has the power to achieve an understanding and to actually put together a deal that he could make stick. I think there is a big question mark in this regard, and therefore I believe that the dialogue has to continue to see whether these two elements can interact in a way in which there will be no concessions and the number-one priority is implemented, namely, the freeing of the hostages.

MacNEIL: Mr. Rumsfeld, is the position we're not going to negotiate with the terrorists, is that a realistic position?

Sec. RUMSFELD: I think that the -- 

MacNEIL: I mean, isn't there in fact going to be, and hasn't there been all along, veiled negotiation to get this exchange done and get it over with?

Sec. RUMSFELD: Well, obviously there have been a lot of public pronouncements by Nabih Berri and by President Reagan and by a whole number of participants to this exercise. But I think what's important to appreciate, from the standpoint of the United States, is that it's the obligation of the President of the United States to interest himself in the safety of these hostages to be sure, but it's also to interest himself in the safety of the American people all across this globe. And he has to, for example, recognize that how he manages this situation will have an effect on the lives of other Americans, and we can't withdraw from the world. We have interests in the world. Second, it will have an effect on Western Europe. What will Western Europe think if the United States alters its policy dramatically because we have hostages held? That would suggest to them that our commitments to Europe are not worth much. What would King Hussein in Jordan, who we have an obligation and interest in seeing proceed with the peace process in the Middle East -- what's his view when he sees U.S. policy spin a 180-degree turn -- were it to do so -- because some hostages were taken? So a President has an obligation that is broader and bigger, it seems to me, than the kind of public micromanagement and amateur brain-surgeoning that's taking place on the public airwaves with respect to this crisis.

Rev. JACKSON: It seems to me that we ought to call a negotiation a negotiation and we ought to call a linkage, linkage because that's what we are looking at. We ought to seek the release of the hostages, the 47 of them, not just the 40 of them, but release and re-evaluation of our foreign policy is in order, for when you negotiate you are in fact using moral authority and credibility and leverage.

MacNEIL: Mr. Rumsfeld says that it would weaken the overall posture of the United States if the President were to do something to achieve what you've just described which made other nations doubt.

Rev. JACKSON: One of the re-evaluation factors is that in that region we have substantial interests but our -- we have too few interests and too few friends, and so a good foreign policy there must broaden the base of friends and allies. It is not good politics, in my judgment, or good reasoning in that region to have a secondary relationship between our President and Mr. Assad as opposed to a primary one. We ought to be against terrorism, but then you can't really say it with gusto when you're South Africa's number-one trading partner. And that's why re-evaluation is as important as our negotiating for release.

MacNEIL: What do you think of that, Mr. Sisco, that we need to re-evaluate the whole foreign policy in the area?

Sec. SISCO: Well, my own judgment is that as far as President Assad is concerned, with whom I have had over the years as many as 15 or 20 meetings, this is a tough, shrewd Syrian nationalist and objectively speaking, there are reasons why he should want a semblance of stability in Lebanon, largely because he's got internal problems of his own to attend to. I believe the course of our policy in the Middle East has been sound. We've been the indispensable third-party element to try to make progress on the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian issue. The only progress that's been made over the last 12 years has been under the aegis of the United States, and therefore the fact that we're an object of terrorism I think attests to the fact that we're the crucial element in the situation.

Sec. RUMSFELD: I would add this, if I might, that with the exception of Syria and Iran and Libya, I think it's reasonable to say that most of the nations of the Middle East, the overwhelming majority, are deeply concerned about terrorism. They are in fear for their regimes, for their diplomats. A number of Jordanian diplomats have been killed. It is not to suggest that by suddenly altering our policy with respect to terrorism that we would gain the friendship of these nations. They're as concerned as we are about terrorism.

MacNEIL: I'd just like to go around to each of you very quickly: do you think that if the measures we heard outlined, the economic boycott, the closing of the airport, were achieved, that they would increase the pressure on the people holding the hostages? Mr. Sisco, do you think so?

Sec. SISCO: A psychological signal that we're there and that we have power, but I do not assume that it will have or would have any decisive impact on the actual dialogue that's going on.

MacNEIL: Mr. Rumsfeld?

Sec. RUMSFELD: My view is that the President of the United States has a very difficult assignment in this instance, that the task ought to be not to simplify the problem for the terrorists and those who wish us ill but to complexify it. And I don't think that by discussing specific things he might do that it contributes constructively to his handling of it.

MacNEIL: What do you think of the measures -- 

Rev. JACKSON: If we're not the essential supplier to Lebanon, then cutting off supplies will not radically affect that situation. Secondly, if that were a coherent government as we know governments to be, that would work better than it would work in this situation. I think that appealing more and more to Israel, appealing more and more to Syria to be an active third force in this situation may be our best route out. And I hope that we will pursue the route of negotiation and if there are other options the government certainly ought to reserve the right to not surface them.

MacNEIL: Thank you. Jim?

LEHRER: Yes, back to you, Senator Lugar. You've been listening to this. Is Reverend Jackson right that the answer to this really lies with Israel and Syria?

Sen. LUGAR: Not necessarily, but clearly our request to Assad to help in Syria is an important one. He could make a big difference. He could influence Nabih Berri and, indeed, they may have been in consultation today on this point. So that's an important link. Israel is crucial for a good number of reasons, some of which are obvious, some of which may be seen in the future. But I think, as Mr. Rumsfeld said, we need to have a complex series of things as opposed to trying to define what will work, what won't work, quantify it in advance. Let's sort of keep the ball rolling.

LEHRER: Well, is Syria being helpful thus far?

Sen. LUGAR: Well, I don't want to characterize that dialogue. It's an important one. It's an on-going one presently. And I would just appeal for everybody to keep that channel open and to suspend judgment until we really know what they're willing to do.

LEHRER: For whatever reasons, is there any indication tonight that Israel may soon release the 700 detainees?

Sen. LUGAR: No more so than last night. Israel will move in accordance with Israeli law. That's what Israel ought to do. I reject entirely the idea of linkage, of negotiation with terrorists. That will not going to occur on our part or that of Israel.

LEHRER: Well, what about Reverend Jackson's point, whether you call it negotiation or not, it's still negotiations if you're talking to people.

Sen. LUGAR: Not necessarily so. There's a pretty good distinction between negotiations and consultation, conversation, whispering in the ear or this type of thing. I think when we're talking about negotiations we are defining parties, their status, their legitimacy, and it has a very important distinction.

LEHRER: All right, Senator Lugar, thank you very much. Robin?

MacNEIL: Still to come on the NewsHour tonight, the failure of House and Senate conferees to agree on a new budget with two of the key players, Senator William Armstrong and Congressman William Gray; and a newsmaker interview with Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert Packwood. Budget Stalemate

LEHRER: Now to focus segment two, the breakdown on the budget. Two weeks ago 26 members of a House and Senate conference committee opened negotiations over how to trim the 1986 federal budget. Both agreed $56-or-so billion was the right amount, but disagreed over how to do it. The big differences were over defense spending and Social Security. Well, today they hollered uncle. Compromise turned out to be impossible, said they; the conference committee's work is done and has failed. First, correspondent June Cross reports on the two weeks of wrangling that led to today's breakdown.

JUNE CROSS [voice-over]: The Senate wants to freeze cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. The House wants a freeze on defense. There things stood last Wednesday when Senate conference chairman Pete Domenici offered a compromise. The Senate would add more for low-income programs, but only if the House would add inflation increases for defense. House conference chairman Bill gray nixed that idea. Then on Friday he made a counter-offer. The House would eliminate $1.5 billion more in social spending, but there would be no give on either defense or Social Security. That led Senate Republican Slade Gorton to call the Democrats' bluff.

Sen. SLADE GORTON, (R) Washington [June 21st]: I don't see any really serious changes in this from the original House position at all. They have made no changes at all in the two largest functions of defense and in the various income security and Social Security areas, and they've made exceedingly cosmetic changes in a number of other areas. By their own figures they amount to only $1.5 billion.

Rep. BILL HEFNER, (D) North Carolina: A billion and a half is not chicken feed. In some of the areas we made very -- more cuts were very painful, such as in the Appalachia Regional Commission, the EDA, all these other areas. We didn't -- if that's going to be the position, we should decide and not waste members' time sitting talking about different functions. If we're going to accomplish nothing, it's no point in sitting here. So let's take out and go to the House.

Sen. DOMENICI: We went about 90 your way on what you called poverty programs. We didn't even argue whether they were or they weren't. Out 90 when you take housing out. That isn't enough. I mean, your counter-offer, no, it might say thanks, but in the meantime it says you want all of it.

CROSS [voice-over]: Democratic Senator Lawton Chiles attempted to bridge the gap between Senate Republicans and the House Democrats.

Sen. LAWTON CHILES, (D) Florida: I'm sure that with the cards that we're now playing with there's no way you can play this hand and come out with a deficit reduction that is sufficient to really help this economy the way we should.

Rep. WILLIAM GRAY, (D) Pennsylvania, Budget Committee chairman: You know, we've got two issues here, defense and Social Security. No, I'm not making an offer at this point because I'm not authorized to do so for my conferees, but you know maybe what we could do is we give your defense and you give us the COLA. Then we can begin to fight on the rest of it right here. How do you think about that?

Sen. DOMENICI: What?!

Rep. GRAY: It's split.

Sen. DOMENICI: All your way. I mean, on the major account.

Rep. GRAY: You'd get defense.

Sen. DOMENICI: You said, you give us our defense and we give you your COLAs? I didn't hear it that way; I heard it the reverse. You said we go with our defense number and your COLA number? Is that your offer, not that I'm going to accept it.

Rep. GRAY: No, that's not an offer.

CROSS [voice-over]: Although Gray's joke had lessened the tension, no one had budged. Democrats and Republicans on both sides talked among themselves over the weekend. They talked some more behind closed doors yesterday. But for all the talking, the two sides were no closer today than they were last week.

Sen. DOMENICI [June 25th]: I don't want this to be interpreted in any way that the House conferees and in particular the distinguished chairman of the House conference have not tried their very best. It's just one of those situations where now that, consistent with the confines of these two budget resolutions, there seems to the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of this conference and the chairman of the Senate conferees, that no useful purpose will be served, with the situation being what it is, for us to proceed.

CROSS [voice-over]: The deadlock makes compromise seem impossible. House and Senate leaders say that makes it likely that both houses will pass their own spending bills without agreeing on any budget resolution at all.

LEHRER: On the House side of the negotiations, House Budget Committee chairman William Gray is with us; from the Senate, Senator William Armstrong, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. They are both in a studio on Capitol Hill. Senator Armstrong, what went wrong from your perspective?

Sen. WILLIAM ARMSTRONG: Well, I don't think we're off the rails yet. We're at a point of decision-making, and I believe that the breakdown or the suspension of the budget conference now is really quite timely, because I think what'll happen is that as the members go home over the 4th of July recess they're going to hear from their constituents, "You guys get back to the table and put something together."

LEHRER: Do you really think the public cares that much about this?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Yes, indeed I do. In fact, the republic's got a lot of things on its mind, but with the possible exception of the hostage issue, I believe that the most pressing public policy concern that people feel at home, that they really feel in their heart, is this budget deficit question.

LEHRER: Well, Senator, if you were to go home to Colorado, is there anything a constituent could tell you that would change your view on any of these issues that caused this breakdown?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Well, you know, I don't think I'm the crux of the matter because I'm there to make a deal. In fact, I think we're a lot closer perhaps than some people might believe. And the essence of a good deal at this point would be to take the low numbers. Where the House is low, take the House numbers. Where the Senate is low, take the Senate numbers. Now, that would mean, in my opinion, that we'd end up pretty close to the Senate numbers on domestic programs and cost-of-living adjustments and pretty close to the House numbers on national defense. There'd be a lot of people who'd holler about that, but in one form or another -- 

LEHRER: In other words -- 

Sen. ARMSTRONG: -- it'd be popular in a lot of places.

LEHRER: In simple terms, you would still cut defense spending about what? Explain that in the two key areas, Social Security and defense.

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Well, the essence of it is that the Senate has proposed to cut Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, the cost-of-living adjustments for federal employees, retirees and others and a number of other domestic programs. I'm saying in my own opinion a good compromise would be to take the Senate numbers on those programs and then in defense, where we're above the House, to go to the House number. In other words, it'd be a symmetrical compromise, but it'd be a compromise for lower spending rather than for bidding spending up.

LEHRER: Congressman Gray, is that the makings of a deal?

Rep. GRAY: No, I don't think it is the makings of a deal. I think clearly when you look at the vote that we had in the House for a budget resolution, they got the greatest number of votes since the budget act bipartisanly. We were saying that there are some policy choices that we have to make and not just numbers. The policy choices were to restrain defense spending, give defense a $15.1-billion increase, freeze budget authority; secondly, reduce domestic spending a great deal but without eliminating a dozen programs and providing for an inflationary increase for low-income programs and then a policy decision bipartisanly made that we did not want to freeze the cost-of-living adjustment for our veterans and for our elderly. We are not freezing defense, we are freezing the budget authority. You are getting $15.1 billion additional in outlays. And it was the feeling of the House bipartisanly that that would be inappropriate. What we suggested to our colleagues in the Senate was that the framework for a decision might be one for the defense question and the COLA question to be linked together structurally and that we would move to their position on the budget authority on defense, which is what the President wanted and which also Caspar Weinberger said was needed, and they would also come to our position on COLAs. And thus, as a result of last week's deliberations, where we clearly demonstrated a willingness to cut more as well as eliminate half a dozen programs which we had not eliminated in the House budget proposal and their willingness to go up in the low-income programs, we felt that we could come to some discussion -- decision.

LEHRER: And then what happened, Congressman?

Rep. GRAY: Essentially what was said, as you heard in your little film clip when I made that suggestion last Friday, it was further amplified later, and the answer was no.

LEHRER: Senator, why is the answer no?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Well, because that's just a suggestion to compromise at the higher figures in each case. In other words, Congressman Gray is proposing that we compromise at the Senate number, which is the high number in defense and at the House number, which is the high number on domestic programs, and you end up without any material budget savings at all.

LEHRER: What would the -- 

Sen. ARMSTRONG: I'm saying let's go to the lower numbers in each case and get a bigger deficit reduction, which is clearly what's needed. I mean, the economy needs that, it's obvious to all of us.

LEHRER: In other words, the net result of doing what Congressman Gray proposed would not have been a $56-billion budget cut?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Oh, no. It'd be much less than $56 billion depending on how far you went in that direction, but obviously if you take the higher numbers in every budget function you end up with less savings than either the House or Senate had on their own.

LEHRER: He's right, isn't he, Congressman?

Rep. GRAY: No. I would have to disagree with my colleague, Senator Armstrong. If you did exactly what I said, go to the budget authority figure for '86 that the Senate had -- the budget authority figure, and go to our figure on COLAs, you would have, including the cuts of 1.5 additional that we gave last week, you would be talking about a $57.5-billion deficit reduction package, which is $7 billion more than what the President asked for, and $2.5 billion more than what the Senate did. What we're really talking about is notsimply numbers and not simply going to the lowest number. We are talking about policy choices and trying to bring about some balance and equity in choosing policy. And so I don't think it's adequate enough to just say let's go to the low figure, because the House has said we do not want to penalize our veterans, our senior citizens, who have already had some very significant cuts over the last four years. And we have said that we do want to give an increase to the low-income programs, but we do want to cut those non-defense discretionary spending programs.

LEHRER: Senator Armstrong, let me ask you this. It's two weeks now that you've sat across the table from Congressman Gray and his House colleagues. Was the spirit of compromise in the air from the other side from your perspective?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Yes, I think so. I don't take lightly what's happened today, but it's not the end of the world. We've been through these things before, and there's sort of a ritual to it. I believe we're going to make a deal and I believe that even some things that perhaps some of the participants are now saying are unthinkable will be thinkable and will be done.

LEHRER: Why?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Because, in the end, the greatest penalty that we can inflict upon the people of this country -- the veterans, the poor, business, working men and women, municipalities; everybody that has a stake in it, the worst thing we can do -- is to just let these enormous deficits occur. We're faced with the prospect of $200 billion in deficits every year, and if that happens, our country's economy is going through the wringer. And so I think a lot of us are going to be prepared to sacrifice on defense, on cost-of-living adjustments and other things in order to prevent it.

LEHRER: Congressman Gray, do you anticipate going home to Philadelphia and then coming back after the 4th of July with a new view toward what you could compromise on this deal?

Rep. GRAY: Well, I don't know. I certainly would be interested in hearing what the American public has to say about the policy choices. We in the House have offered a series of policy choices that give you strong reduction by spending cuts of over $56 billion. The compromise I just suggested, which, by the way, a Republican member of Congress, Jack Kemp, in the conference today, said was an outstanding attempt at compromise which he would support, and he did not vote for the House budget. I believe that that represents a good choice for the American people. Obviously the Senate does not. I think that if the Senate budget was put back on the floor of the Senate it would not pass. However, be that as it may, it is my hope that we will come back and will be able to reach agreement. If we do not, I am going to urge the leadership of the House to move forward with our appropriation bills in July and achieve the $56-billion worth of spending cuts by keeping under the targets set by the Budget Committee and thus show the American people by September that we have cut spending for fiscal year '86.

LEHRER: And just go it alone, in other words?

Rep. GRAY: If necessary, go it alone, and because I just think that when I see the President, who is walking away from this process, Stockman revising his estimates, a tax reform package that is a revenue loser, I think that the problem that my friend Mr. Domenici faces -- and I have the greatest respect for him -- is that basically he doesn't have enough support to do what he needs to do in terms of compromising on some key issues like defense and COLAs.

LEHRER: Is that right, Senator Armstrong?

Sen. ARMSTRONG: No, I don't think so. I think in fact that it's easy to talk about achieving these budget savings without a budget resolution, as Congressman Gray is doing, if all you're really talking about doing is whacking it out of defense, which is the biggest single component of the House plan. We're calling in the Senate resolution, and I hope in the final version, that we will see basic reform, meaning statutory change in programs like Amtrak, UDAG and many of the programs -- the Ex-Im Bank. That's not a simple job and you can't just do it through appropriations. You need the discipline of the budget process.

LEHRER: All right. Well, gentlemen, both of you have a good holiday and we'll see you and what happens when you come back.

Sen. ARMSTRONG: Thanks.

Rep. GRAY: Thanks a lot.

LEHRER: Robin?

MacNEIL: They just mentioned tax reform. In the last few weeks President Reagan has been pushing his tax reform, tax simplification plan as a proposal that will benefit all Americans. Tonight we have a newsmaker interview with the man faced with the political realities of getting that tax plan, or some version of it, through Congress. He is Republican Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Judy Woodruff has the interview and the background. Judy? Tax Reform: Fair to All?

JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Packwood has said he agrees with the need for tax reform in general, but he has charged that the Reagan tax plan hurts middle-class taxpayers. Specifically he objects to a proposal to eliminate a key deduction for families with two wage earners who can currently write off part of their income. And he also opposes part of the administration's plan which reduces the tax benefit for families who deduct child care expenses, a concept the administration itself is now considering rewriting. Senator Packwood joins us here in our Washington studio.

Senator, first of all, let me ask you about this stalemate on the budget. What effect does it have on tax reform if there is no, or if there may be no, agreement on budget?

Sen. ROBERT PACKWOOD: Almost none, Judy. We've been moving along on tax reform. The House has been having hearings, we've been having hearings in the Senate. And we were going to go along and get a tax bill or not get a tax bill, as the case may be, regardless of the budget. So it makes no difference.

WOODRUFF: Which one takes precedence in your mind?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Oh, in my mind getting the deficit down, the budget takes precedence. We can do both, but if you had to pick just one, I would pick the budget and the deficit reduction because we will work and sweat and scream and argue about the tax reform bill and at the end of it, if we're lucky, it's what we call revenue neutral -- it doesn't lose any money, it doesn't pick up any money. So it means it doesn't make a dime's dent in the deficit.

WOODRUFF: So if there is no agreement on the deficit, what you're saying is that tax reform what, has the same -- 

Sen. PACKWOOD: Tax reform goes right ahead because the budget was unrelated to the tax reform bill. The budget that passed the House, the budget that passed the Senate, didn't ask for any additional taxes. So there was no imposition on my committee in the Senate and Chairman Rostenkowski in the House to come up with any new taxes. And the President's tax reform bill doesn't ask for any new taxes. So we're just working along on a bill that, if we succeed, will not increase nor, hopefully, decrease the federal revenues.

WOODRUFF: We just heard Senator Armstrong say that he thinks the number-one priority, domestic priority in the minds of Americans now is deficit reduction. He didn't mention tax reform in that context. Where is the priority on tax reform?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, when you go home -- and this is the best way you can judge it, because letters are now so instigated you're never sure if they're an accurate reflection of public opinion. There is no question when you go home the top of the list question is deficit, deficit, deficit, cut defense spending, put limitations on the COLAs, get those deficits down. Tax reform is much lower down in the public conscious -- they may get to it, but normally -- normally when you get to it, it is a question asked by somebody who doesn't like some particular provision in the tax reform plan.

WOODRUFF: So how does that affect you and the goal you've set for yourself?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Oh, when you've been in this business long enough, you realize it's the squeaky wheel that you hear. Those who benefit from the tax reform plan, and there are many who do benefit, don't say much about it. Those who are hurt, or think they're hurt, complain a lot. And you've got to judge that and you've got to realize that the complainers are not always a majority.

WOODRUFF: All right, let's talk about your objection to abandoning the deduction for two-earner families. First of all, in simple terms, how does the current law work?

Sen. PACKWOOD: In simple terms it works as follows. Let's say you make $25,000 and your husband makes $20,000. And before you got married you each paid a tax -- you on 25; he paid a tax on 20.

WOODRUFF: Thanks for giving me the higher salary.

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, I know your husband, as a matter of fact. He'll probably call me on that when I said that. But in any event, there is a situation where often you paid less taxes individually than you paid collectively if you got married. That was called the marriage penalty, and it was incentive -- alleged an incentive -- not to get married. So we passed a law some time ago that said in that situation you can take as a deduction 10 of the lesser earning spouse's amount. In your case, if your husband made $20,000, you could take a $2,000 deduction. The administration's bill just gets rid of that.

WOODRUFF: And what does that mean for the middle class?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, what it means is that if you've got a wife and a husband, say, total they're making $30-, $35,000 together and they've got a couple of children and maybe one's four or five and one of them's in a day care facility, they probably come out losers on the bill by a slight amount, and I don't -- none of us in Congress intended that. I don't think the administration deliberately intended that, but it was interesting when we first had the statistics from the Treasury Department, one of us -- I wasn't, but one of us should have been smart enough to say, wait a minute, there's something missing because there were no statistics on these two-earner families.

WOODRUFF: Well, now what are you saying, because I remember Secretary Baker, the treasury secretary, said that middle-income families will benefit?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, but the statistics we had were one-earner families and normally it was husband works, wife stays home. Therefore they have no day care expenses either because the wife is staying home with the children. Now, were those statistics left out intentionally? I hope not. But none of us caught it initially. One of the nice things you can say about lobbying groups in the town of Washington, because they always get knocked a lot, is in this case the ones that picked it up first were the lobbying groups that represent the single parents who are interested in day care or representing two-earner families, and they caught this right away.

WOODRUFF: So you're proposing that we keep the law as is?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, I think the treasury's going to change it, unless I miss my guess, because I don't think the administration wants to go forward with a bill that is going to penalize people who are not taking advantage of shelters -- they're not putting their money in cattle feed lots or something like that. They are honest, decent people who bowl on Wednesday and take their kids hunting and fishing on Saturday, and they're lucky to make $30-, $35,000, and I cannot believe that the administration wants to penalize them.

WOODRUFF: Now, the same thing with the child care tax benefit.

Sen. PACKWOOD: What you had there -- at the moment you have what is known as a child care credit. A credit is money you can deduct from the taxes you actually owe. If you have a $200 credit and you owe $1,000 taxes, you pay $800. That's a credit. A deduction is an amount that you deduct from your total income before you figure your taxes. You make $50,000, you have a $1,000 deduction, you pay taxes on $49,000. Well, if you're in the 50 tax bracket, and you deduct $1,000, that's worth $500 to you. If you're in the 20 tax bracket, it's worth $200, whereas a credit is worth the same to everybody, rich or poor. So it tilts downward toward the poorer families.

WOODRUFF: So what do you think the administration will do on that?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Well, I don't know what the administration will do on this because they knew what the credit was, they changed it from a credit, which tilts toward lower income to a deduction, which tilts toward higher income. That, combined with the elimination of this so-called marriage deduction, hurts a lot of middle-income, two-earner families with one or two children. And I just cannot believe the administration wants to do that.

WOODRUFF: But you said a minute ago you don't know -- 

Sen. PACKWOOD: I don't know what they're going to do.

WOODRUFF: -- if it was done deliberately or what. I mean, what do you think? I mean, you talk to these people.

Sen. PACKWOOD: I hope not. I hope not. Well, I don't think Jim Baker, the secretary of the treasury, did it deliberately. I mean, I know him. I know the knock that's going around. You know, Pat Buchanan says a traditional family is the man and you stay home and take care of the kids and we won't have as many drug problems and juvenile delinquency problems and auto wrecks and all of that. And that isn't the typical family anymore. The typical married family today, the husband and the wife work, for money, in the marketplace.

WOODRUFF: So do you think the administration is just behind the times or what?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Oh, we all indulge in nostalgia and we all remember when we grew up, and I guess when most of us my age grew up there were many, many, many fewer women, fewer mothers in the work force working for money. Today that is just not the situation, and we're not going to turn the clock back. We're not going to go back. Those women are not going to leave the labor force. And we might as well realize that that is the family in America today.

WOODRUFF: You'd like to see these provisions changed, obviously. Any other provisions in there that you think doom or seriously hurt the prospects for the administration's plan?

Sen. PACKWOOD: Oh, everything -- almost everything that's in it causes the bill to have some negatives in some people'sminds. You're familiar with the -- especially New York City and the state and local tax deduction. Any state that's a high-tax state thinks that they suffer under this. But I think on that what you want to do is look at the bill at the end. The example I would give you there, would you rather pay 10 taxes on $20,000 of income, which would be $2,000 taxes, or would you rather pay 4 or 5 taxes on $30,000 income and not have any deductions? Clearly the latter.

WOODRUFF: Overall, do you still predict a bill by the end of the year?

Sen. PACKWOOD: It's tight, but if the House can get a bill to the Senate by October 15th, we can have one to the President by the end of the year.

WOODRUFF: Senator Robert Packwood, thank you for being with us.

Sen. PACKWOOD: Thank you.

WOODRUFF: Jim?

LEHRER: Again, the major stories of this day. President Reagan is considering an economic boycott of Lebanon. House and Senate conferees broke off negotiations on a 1986 federal budget, saying their differences were irreconcilable for now, and more than 20 persons died in a series of explosions in an Oklahoma fireworks factory. Good night, Robin.

MacNEIL: Good night, Jim. That's our NewsHour tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good night.
